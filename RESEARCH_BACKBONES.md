# 🔬 Research-Friendly Backbones

Perfect for developing novel ReID techniques with room for improvement!

## 🎯 Available Research Backbones

### **SWIN Transformers** (Hierarchical Vision Transformers)
```python
# SWIN-B: Good baseline with room for improvement (~75-85% expected)
BACKBONE = 'swin_base_patch4_window7_224'    # 1024D features

# SWIN-L: Strong but not dominant (~80-90% expected) 
BACKBONE = 'swin_large_patch4_window7_224'   # 1536D features

# SWIN-L High-Res: Higher resolution version
BACKBONE = 'swin_large_patch4_window12_384'  # 1536D features
```

### **DINOv3 Base** (Smaller than your perfect DINOv3-L)
```python
# DINOv3-B: Strong foundation with improvement potential (~85-95% expected)
BACKBONE = 'dinov3_vitb16'  # 768D features
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Test All Backbones:**
```bash
# Test which backbones work on your system
uv run python test_research_backbones.py
```

### **Research Configuration:**
```bash
# Train with SWIN-L (room for improvement)
uv run python train_dogreid.py --config config_research.py

# Or manually set backbone in config_training.py:
BACKBONE = 'swin_large_patch4_window7_224'
EMBED_DIM = 768  # Project 1536 -> 768
```

## 💡 Research Strategy

### **1. Choose Your Backbone**
```python
# For maximum novelty space:
BACKBONE = 'swin_base_patch4_window7_224'  # ~75-85% baseline

# For moderate novelty space:  
BACKBONE = 'swin_large_patch4_window7_224'  # ~80-90% baseline

# For minimal novelty space:
BACKBONE = 'dinov3_vitb16'  # ~85-95% baseline
```

### **2. Novel Techniques to Try**
- **Advanced Loss Functions**: ArcFace, CosFace, CircleLoss
- **Attention Mechanisms**: CBAM, SE-Net, Non-local attention
- **Multi-Scale Features**: FPN, Feature pyramids
- **Data Augmentation**: MixUp, CutMix, AutoAugment
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Learn from DINOv3-L teacher
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Contrastive pretraining

### **3. Evaluation Protocol**
```python
# Baseline performance
baseline_mAP = evaluate(swin_model)  # ~80%

# Your improved method
improved_mAP = evaluate(swin_model + your_technique)  # ~90%?

# Upper bound
upper_bound = evaluate(dinov3_l_model)  # ~100%

# Calculate improvement
improvement = improved_mAP - baseline_mAP  # +10%!
```
